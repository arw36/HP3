# HP3: Zoogeographical Cross-Validation




# Zoogeographic Cross-Validation

In addition to randomly-selected k-fold cross-validation, we evaluated the robustness of our models via non-random geographic cross-validation: we systematically removed all observations from a zoogeographical region, re-fit the model using all observations from outside the region, then performed a non-parametric permutation test comparing the predicted values to the observed values for that region.

In order to meaningfully organize geographic areas, we utilized mammalian zoogeographic regions from [*Holt et al (2013)*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1228282) which are defined by distributions of and phylogenetic relationships between species. Using QGIS, a mammal-specific zoogeographical shapefile provided by [Holt's group](http://macroecology.ku.dk/resources/wallace) at the University of Copenhagen was intersected (using QGIS Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Intersect) with a shapefile of IUCN's host ranges. Areas of these intersections were then calculated using an equal-area projection, and each host was assigned to only the region which contained the greatest proportion of its range. Results of the non-parametric permutation test are shown below; non-significant results indicate that model predictions are unbiased.

Dark green indicates unbiased regions, while dark red indicates regions with evidence of biased predictions. Light green and light red represent the same distinction, but these regions contain very few (less than ten) assigned species; blank areas were not assigned any hosts.

#Cross-validation Results
The reviewer articulated concerns about our models' ability to make out-of-sample predictions, arguing that cross-validation based on random folds does not adequately address this issue. This analysis suggests that our *All Zoonoses*, *All Viruses*, and *Strict Viruses* models are fairly robust to a systematic cross-validation that creates folds based on geographical/phylogenetic region ~ a non-random method to approximate out-of-sample testing. For each of these three models, only 4-5 substantial (n > 10) folds show evidence of bias, while 10-11 substantial folds are well-predicted. 

For the *Strict Zoonoses* model the evidence is more equivocal, with 8 substantial regions that show evidence of bias and 7 substantial regions which are well-predicted. This suggests that there might be some association between zoogeographical region and number of strictly-defined zoonoses present in animals. In order to further explore possibility of an association between region and our model outcomes, we included region as a random effect variable in each of our models below

#Region as Random Effect
## All Zoonoses GAM


Adding zoogeographical region as a random effect to our best-fit All Zoonoses GAM does not improve the model (AIC~region~: 1517.584 vs AIC~original~: 1517.583); the effective degrees of freedom for the region smooth is very low (1.7\times 10^{-4}), which supports removing the region variable from the All Zoonoses GAM.
